Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble
	
  The OPS General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.	

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the OPS General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
OPS General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

 The OPSLicenses Not Freedom. OPSKoreanTeam Will Use CCL.
